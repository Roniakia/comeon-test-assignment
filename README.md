## Getting Started

Development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### What I already made
- Auth
- Game
- Game cards
- Search
- It should look OKAY on different resolutions
- Add a couple of new endpoints
- Change a little some objects on mock server
- Change UI a little
- Change some use flow on the site
- Use next.js for first time for fun.

### What can be improved in my opinion if I'll spend more time

- Change a little API endpoints (for examlple merge ```/login``` and ```/logout``` into ```/session```)
- Use cookies for auth instead of localStorage
- More polishing for some styles
- Add fullscreen mode for games
- Change a liitle file handling conventions
- Git commit messages - I prefer to open one PR for one feature and have a good history 
with readable messages, but it's a test assignment with different things to do 
  so I just omitted this rule
- It would be nice to add debounce for search input
- Store API host in ENV and create Provider for configuration
